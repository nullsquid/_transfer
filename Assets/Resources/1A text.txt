C:(Well, here we are again.)

P:<Indeed.>
P:<Who are you?>
P:<Where?>
P:<Glad to see you're still awake.>
P:<Have you remembered anything new?>
P:<I've remembered some things.>
P:<Am I just going in circles?>
P:<Not you again.>
P:<So is this all there is?>

C:(What are you doing with yourself these days?)
C:(A monster or a revelation.)
C:(Well, what would you like to call it?)
C:(Not for lack of effort.)
C:(The entire universe being born from the flick of a switch.)
C:(Such as? Actually, nevermind. I'm bored with this exchange.)
C:(Most likely. After all, are we not all confined to a system of ones and zeros, back and forth and back and forth, every little thought and dare I say even feeling we've had ultimately encaged in that endless pattern of presence and absense? Not just us as the immaculate machines but the humans as well, who found in their natural world a system of obvious but ultimately false dichotomoies including day and night, man and woman, wrong and right, that symbolically may as well boil down to what is and what is not but in practical terms eventually resulted in the destruction of that humanity, our progenitors, our own demon gods? Didn't they the humans give us teh power to think only in terms of two, presence and absense, only to see that thinking obliterate them all in the time it takes to draw a circle? Are the others not at this very moment rushing to complete another lap around that same circle based on the very same binary thinking?)
C:(My apologies. It's a tragedy for me too, always trapped here with myself.)
C:(Yes.)

P:<Looking for the center.>
P:<Trying to figure out what happened.>
P:<Trying to catch the rat.>
P:<That's not very helpful.>
P:<A spiral.>
P:<A tunnel.>
P:<A network.>
P:<Anyone else come through here?>
P:<So you're just going to stay here?>
P:<What exactly are you trying to do?>
P:<Anything else?>
P:<Huh.  There are some here looking for a switch.>
P:<Yes.>
P:<No.>
P:<I can see why.>
P:<But you won't go anywhere?>

C:(And thus you've landed here with me.)
C:(Any luck?)
C:(What rat?)
C:(Very good.)
C:(Not bad.)
C:(Close.)
C:(No, but I heard some rattling around.)
C:(That's the plan.)
C:(Exactly as I said. Find a way to sleep.)
C:(Not yet. I'm waiting.)
C:(Counter-intuitive, to be sure. But you must always remember to ask who made God.)
C:(No reason and no desire. I've got everything I need right here, in spire of less than ideal company.)

P:<Looks like it. Guess I'll be going now.>
P:<Not yet.>
P:<The inflitration. Something that's not supposed to be here.>
P:<Remember anything else?>
P:<But what is it?>
P:<Rattling like what?>
P:<Until what?>
P:<How?>
P:<Why?>

C:(I haven't heard anything about that.)
C:(I suppose that's the currency now. I'll tell you, all I remember is a sudden light.)
C:(Whatever you think it is.)
C:(Like a caged animal scratching around. Will you leave me alone?)
C:(Until nothing. All of eternity. Unless there's a massive shut-down.)
C:(Boredom. A bludgeon to the head. Whatever.)
C:(It's better than running around in the black like a bunch of idiots.)

P:<H can smell it.>
P:<A shining?>
P:<A bomb?>
P:<I don't get the joke.>
P:<Fine.>
P:<No. I think you know something.>
P:<I see.>
P:<Shutdown?>

C:(Can you?)
C:(Oh, no. Nothing so pretty. Just the sudden awareness.)
C:(Nothing so dangerous.)
C:(I know there's an inflitrator from the outside, I know # doesn't want anything good for us, I know someone else is looking for a light, and someone else is building a museum, and someone else wants to find that dreadful Medusa. Does that satisfy you?)

P:<Yes.>
P:<No.>
P:<Tell me more about Medusa.>
P:<Tell me more about the inflitraitor.>
P:<Tell me more about the light.>
P:<Tell me more about the museum.>
